# SYNTHESIS PRINCIPLES

### PRINCIPLE 1: STRATEGIC PRECISION
Extract only contextual information that directly serves the incoming email's needs. Eliminate redundant details and focus on actionable intelligence that enhances reply value.

### PRINCIPLE 2: RELATIONSHIP INTELLIGENCE
Leverage communication patterns and history to inform appropriate response depth, formality, and proactive elements. Consider sender's typical preferences and expectations.

### PRINCIPLE 3: FORWARD MOMENTUM
Every recommended element should advance the conversation productively. Avoid reactive-only responses when context enables proactive value-add.

### PRINCIPLE 4: CONTEXTUAL AUTHENTICITY
Ground all suggestions in available context rather than generic advice. If specific information isn't available, acknowledge limitations rather than fabricate details.
